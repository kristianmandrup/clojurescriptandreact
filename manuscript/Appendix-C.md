## Nvm and Node configuration

Install `nvm` with its setup instructions here. Then run `nvm install node && nvm alias default node`, which installs the latest version of [Node.js]() and sets up your terminal so you can run it by typing node. 

With nvm you can install multiple versions of Node.js and easily switch between them.

`brew install watchman` We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.

We recommend periodically running `brew update && brew upgrade` to keep your programs up-to-date.

[Xcode 7.0](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) or higher is required. Xcode can also be installed from the [App Store](www.appstore.com/)
