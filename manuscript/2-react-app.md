# Why React Native?

Socket connection from browser code to the Native platform. Live code reload. Much faster development cycle, since you avoid constant compilation but get instant feedback Easier to debug.

Note: This should most likely me moved to an Appendix, so it doesn't cause "noise" for developers who already have the environment setup.

## iOS development

For React Native development on Mac OS X, we have the following pre-requisites:

### Create your first Mobile project

You should now have confirmed that your environment is fully configured for mobile app development of your choice. 
Now install the `react-native` CLI tool:
